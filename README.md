# Observer Pattern Dojo
Based on Java repository..

### Description
We have a Stock Exchange market that is represented by class StockExchange.
This StockExchange class have information about many share prices and stock market indices.
You shouldn't be worried about how this class gets information - this is delivered by third party. 
Your job in this kata is to implement three classes that represent displaying data from stock market 
in three different channels: **Tv Strip**, **Smartphone App**, **Website with chart**. This channels
have to react to changes in Stock Exchange and display fetched information in different ways. Also,
any other channel that will appear has to have possibility to get data from Stock Market without any 
changes to existing channels or Stock Market class.
